## Social Network API Challenge

For this challenge, we were tasked with building an API for a social network application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends thoughts, and create a friends list. We will be using Insomnia to test our routes, as well as connecting to Mongo DB Compass, where we can also manipulate the data.


## Installation

* npm i
* npm run seed
* npm start

Once listening, you can open Insomnia to test routes. Likewise, you can connect in Mongo DB compass.






* The following shows the app being displayed in Mongo DB Compass
